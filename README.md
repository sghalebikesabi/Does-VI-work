# Does VI work?

This mini project is part of the course on Statistical Machine Learning of the StatML CDT. 

Whilst many diagnostic approaches exist for evaluating the accuracy of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posteriors, relatively few exist for Variational Inference (VI). In this paper, we summarize three recently proposed diagnostics for VI and illustrate their utility in a series of both parametric and nonparametric examples with real world data.
