# Does VI work?

Whilst many diagnostic approaches exist for evaluating the accuracy of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posteriors, relatively few exist for Variational Inference (VI). In this paper, we summarize three recently proposed diagnostics for VI and illustrate their utility in a series of both parametric and nonparametric examples with real world data.
